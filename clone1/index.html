                    <span>A character from the anime SpongeBob SquarePants.</span>
                    <span>The original name was Patrick Star, the name of a person + a starfish.</span>
                    <span>It is a hemispherical rock that is less than half the size of SpongeBob's house or Singer's house, and sleeps under it.</span>
                    <span>Basically, he has a bad head, but he's so weak at using his head that if he rolls his head a little, smoke will come out of his brain.</span>
                    <span>It is often revealed that he has a selfish personality, who always judges things that others should not do, and eventually commits them. SpongeBob is basically sincere and listens well to others, except for the occasional needless thinking, but since he trusts Patrick's judgment in everything he does, there are many times when things go awry while listening to Patrick's argument.</span>

                    <span>In the episode, the high power and drawing are excellent enough to draw the actual sound and the keyboard in sync with the scene where the piano and other instruments are handled.</span>
                    <span>As for the character design, the design changed in the 1950s is well-received, and it is characterized by the fact that the body descriptions of Tom and Jerry become more and more simplified as each episode goes on and become closer to humans.</span>
                    <span>In North America, it had a similar number of theaters to its production cost and benefited from additional revenue outside the United States, TV rights and home video revenue.</span>
                    <span>On the other hand, it is said that the airing was banned in some states in the United States because of excessive violence. Seriously, if you think about it, scenes that would not be strange even if you bleed or die in a real situation, such as smoking a cigar or a cigarette without hesitation on the theme of cats and mice, and splitting Tom's body into several pieces were aired for children.</span>
                    <span>Even so, the reason why it is not felt so much unless you look at it seriously seems to be because it is an exaggerated expression unique to cartoons that ends up being crushed or deformed no matter how much you hit it. However, in other words, it seems to be being re-evaluated in some strange ways.</span>
