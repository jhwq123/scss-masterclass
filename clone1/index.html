                        <span>A character from the anime SpongeBob SquarePants.</span>
                        <span>The original name was Patrick Star, the name of a person + a starfish.</span>
                        <span>It is a hemispherical rock that is less than half the size of SpongeBob's house or Singer's house, and sleeps under it.</span>
                        <span>Basically, he has a bad head, but he's so weak at using his head that if he rolls his head a little, smoke will come out of his brain.</span>
                        <span>It is often revealed that he has a selfish personality, who always judges things that others should not do, and eventually commits them. SpongeBob is basically sincere and listens well to others, except for the occasional needless thinking, but since he trusts Patrick's judgment in everything he does, there are many times when things go awry while listening to Patrick's argument.</span>

                        <span>In the episode, the high power and drawing are excellent enough to draw the actual sound and the keyboard in sync with the scene where the piano and other instruments are handled.</span>
                        <span>As for the character design, the design changed in the 1950s is well-received, and it is characterized by the fact that the body descriptions of Tom and Jerry become more and more simplified as each episode goes on and become closer to humans.</span>
                        <span>In North America, it had a similar number of theaters to its production cost and benefited from additional revenue outside the United States, TV rights and home video revenue.</span>
                        <span>On the other hand, it is said that the airing was banned in some states in the United States because of excessive violence. Seriously, if you think about it, scenes that would not be strange even if you bleed or die in a real situation, such as smoking a cigar or a cigarette without hesitation on the theme of cats and mice, and splitting Tom's body into several pieces were aired for children.</span>
                        <span>Even so, the reason why it is not felt so much unless you look at it seriously seems to be because it is an exaggerated expression unique to cartoons that ends up being crushed or deformed no matter how much you hit it. However, in other words, it seems to be being re-evaluated in some strange ways.</span>

                        <span>Several episodes are centered on the family of Lee Soon-jae, the director of an oriental medicine hospital, where three generations live together.</span>
                        <span>The people living on the 4th floor of the 'Lee Soon-jae Women's Oriental Medicine Hospital' building are the 1st couple Lee Soon-jae & Na Moon-hee, the 2nd couple Lee Jun-ha and Park Hae-mi, the 3rd-generation Lee Min-ho & Lee Yun-ho son of the Jun-ha couple, and Soon-jae's divorce, who lost his newlyweds. The second son Lee Min-yong begins to hide in a rooftop room and the whole is formed.</span>
                        <span>In this episode, the bar installed in the opening of the utility room, the entrance to the civilian room, is the icon of high kick. As an aside, it is not the only two-story house in the High Kick series. For reference, Min-yong's room is definitely a rooftop room, and you can access it through stairs other than the bar.</span>

                        <span>Korean TV program. It is a travel variety program that represents the real wild road variety and draws the travel stories of six men.</span>
                        <span>Season 1 was truly the best national entertainment for all ages. On August 5, 2007, it first aired as a corner of Happy Sunday, and in its early days, it was '2 Days & 1 Night Kang Ho-dong'.</span>
                        <span>In 2 Days 1 Night, we continue to shoot 24 hours a day, but the original 24-hour shooting started with a different intention. Everyone is used to it now, but it was an unfamiliar concept when it first started.</span>
                        <span>Usually, such protests come during filming breaks, so in order to prevent protests from happening, each member placed a VJ with a 6mm camera that is portable and not lacking in picture quality for broadcasting and filmed for 24 hours.</span>
                        <span>In the program format, the more you survive, the more fun it is, so the spirit of slander is always present in all the performers. Even the producers and other ordinary people who frequently participate in the program can be seen being dominated by this energy of the weak and strong food. In addition to this desperate entertainment, it introduces tourist attractions and scenic spots all over the country, and it also promotes publicity as a public broadcaster along with the participation of citizens.</span>

                        <span>As the first tvN series of giant towers and the first in the blue giant tower series, it is a drama about the pain and suffering of Korean Army soldiers (mainly sick), and a military sitcom that calls itself a military drama.</span>
                        <span>It was popular and topical at the time of its airing, but it is still popular after nearly 10 years, and the cast at that time are still recognized as 'the man in the blue tower'.</span>
                        <span>It was originally one of the funniest TV Roller Coaster 2 corners that air on cable channel tvN at 11pm on Sundays. When the first corner was planned and aired, it was only a corner that filled the airing time of Roller Coaster 2 on TV, which was fun.</span>
                        <span>However, due to the hot reaction and popularity of both male and female viewers, it became independent from the fun TV Roller Coaster 2 on January 23, 2013 and started to be aired every Wednesday at 11 PM.</span>
                        <span>Throughout the broadcast, the bed-type dormitory was worn, and the actors wore old combat uniforms. The Ministry of National Defense was aware of this, and in March, a program of the Armed Forces broadcast, the actors appeared in the background of the new bed dormitory in the army's new combat uniform + beret.</span>

                        <span>An entertainment program aired on SBS, a terrestrial broadcasting station in Korea. It is the best Hallyu entertainment in Korea that has a huge overseas fandom that is hard to see in most entertainment shows, and it is a variety entertainment with the largest number of episodes of a single entertainment.</span>
                        <span>As the program is prolonged, games are often played in rural areas or villages, but it is basically a real variety set in a city such as a department store or high-rise building. At the same time, it is a type of program that adds game and action elements. In other words, it is a broadcast centered on the chase. It's not that I don't play games other than the chase, but in most episodes, it's a first half game and a second half chase.</span>
                        <span>The fact that it enjoys great popularity abroad is also one of Running Man's identities. It can be said that it is a representative Hallyu entertainment, but it is safe to say that Running Man's overseas popularity is more than that of any idol group. Although it started 3 years later than the competing professional 1 Night 2 Days, Running Man is much more famous overseas.</span>
                        <span>In the early days, the cast and production team were stunned by their popularity when they saw the crowds of fans flocking to the airport like a cloud. solid Running Man has been airing for the past 11 years to foreign viewers in more than 100 countries, and most of the members, including Lee Kwang-soo and Song Ji-hyo, have become Hallyu stars.</span>
                        <span>It can be said that it is the representative entertainment of SBS in name and reality. Thanks to this, we regularly hold concerts and large-scale fan meetings abroad.</span>

                        <span>The main character of this movie, a typical genius geek. The undemanding Sheldon Lee Cooper and main nerd of 'Three Idiots'. The abbreviation is 'Rancho'. Although he has a decent appearance, genius, and the son of a wealthy family, he is a person who denies social conventions or competitive education itself and does what he likes.</span>
                        <span>However, he feels sorry for his classmates who have to study engineering, which he finds so attractive, just for the sake of competition.</span>
                        <span>However, in the process, severe actions are also immortal. He entered the dormitory at the beginning and did not accept the absurd declaration of the seniors [6] and stayed in his room, and then used a spoon and a ground fault breaker to urinate on his door.</span>
                        <span>Basically, they value their friends very much, think about them, and show them their way, and when they open their mouths, they pour out precious sayings.</span>
                        <span>Even the professors couldn't help but keep their mouths shut, unable to refute this single word of rancho. There are descriptions of awakening the people around them, teaching them something, and feeling emotionally moved by this, and it seems that the teacher is natural.</span>
